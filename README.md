# CEEMDAN-SE-GWO-LSTM

This is a repo for implementing CEEMDAN-SE-GWO-LSTM. CEEMDAN-SE and GWO-LSTM are combined manually in this experiment. 

- CEEMDAN: Divide the waves into several sine or cosine waves. 
- SE: Select the waves that contain the top-$k$ highest information amount to combine to form new waves with less noise.
- GWO: Lead the LSTM as the optimizer.
- LSTM: The core training part.

Thank you so much for the many stars, which make this project the most starred one among all my projects, though I do not focus on artificial intelligence techniques. 

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
